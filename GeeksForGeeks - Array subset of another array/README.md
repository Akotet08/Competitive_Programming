Given two arrays: a1[0..n-1] of size n and a2[0..m-1] of size m, where both arrays may contain duplicate elements. The task is to determine whether array a2 is a subset of array a1. It's important to note that both arrays can be sorted or unsorted. Additionally, each occurrence of a duplicate element within an array is considered as a separate element of the set.
